* [Wiki](https://github.com/CorrelAid/klima-kollektiv/wiki) for tutorials and other help.

# For project set up:
* Clone repo to local folder (local repo).
* Create virtual environment using requirements.txt and update virtual environment after pull from remote repo.
* Folder raw_data is empty because files are too large for github. fill the folder only in your local repo from the [Google Drive folder data](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1IkIbwRA1dFFJGyGPFCmTpKO5LOPnoxR_). Georeferencing was done using QGIS software. 
* Do not push any large files to remote repo, especially any large files from local raw_data folder.
* Every folder contains a README.md for clear information.
