* Communication via slack channel [project-klima-kollektiv-2024-07](https://correlaid.slack.com/archives/C07DAG9RR52)
* Big files are stored in [Google Drive Ordner](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1GW-cFpNl4-H6kCT7CsSK6VPhYxSsGWI1)
* [Wiki](https://github.com/CorrelAid/klima-kollektiv/wiki) f√ºr tutorials etc.
* Minutes from our weekly meetings are stored [here]()


For project set up:
* Clone repo to local folder (local repo).
* Create virtual environment using requirements.txt and update virtual environment after pull from remote repo.
* Folder raw_data is empty because files are too large for github. fill the folder only in your local repo from the [Google Drive Ordner data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IkIbwRA1dFFJGyGPFCmTpKO5LOPnoxR). 
* Do not push any large files to remote repo, i.e. any large files from local raw_data folder.
